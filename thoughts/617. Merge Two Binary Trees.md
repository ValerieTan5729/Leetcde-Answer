# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees

## 题目

[leetcode题目](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/description/)

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

Example 1:
```
nput: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7
```
Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

## 解决
对于这种二叉树的遍历，最适用的方法就是递归。【n1为t1的节点数，n2为t2的节点数】

- 时间复杂度：O(max(n1, n2))
- 空间复杂度：O(n1 + n2)

```C++
// Runtime: 42ms
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* mergeTrees(TreeNode* t1, TreeNode* t2) {
        // Overlap by rules if both nodes aren't nullptr
        if (t1 != NULL && t2 != NULL) { 
            struct TreeNode * root = new TreeNode(t1->val + t2->val);
            // Use recursion to get the corresponding left child and right child
            root->left = mergeTrees(t1->left, t2->left); 
            root->right = mergeTrees(t1->right, t2->right);
            return root;
        } else if (t1 == NULL && t2 != NULL) {
            return t2;
        } else if (t1 != NULL && t2 == NULL) {
            return t1;
        } else {
            return NULL;
        }
    }
};
```
