# 806. Number of Lines To Write String

## 题目
[Leetcode题目](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-lines-to-write-string/description/)

We are to write the letters of a given string `S`, from left to right into lines. Each line has maximum width 100 units, and if writing a letter would cause the width of the line to exceed 100 units, it is written on the next line. We are given an array `widths`, an array where widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', ..., and widths[25] is the width of 'z'.

Now answer two questions: how many lines have at least one character from `S`, and what is the width used by the last such line? Return your answer as an integer list of length 2.

Example :
```
Input: 
widths = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
S = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: [3, 60]
Explanation: 
All letters have the same length of 10. To write all 26 letters,
we need two full lines and one line with 60 units.
```
Example :
```
Input: 
widths = [4,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
S = "bbbcccdddaaa"
Output: [2, 4]
Explanation: 
All letters except 'a' have the same length of 10, and 
"bbbcccdddaa" will cover 9 * 10 + 2 * 4 = 98 units.
For the last 'a', it is written on the second line because
there is only 2 units left in the first line.
So the answer is 2 lines, plus 4 units in the second line.
```

Note:

- The length of `S` will be in the range [1, 1000].
- `S` will only contain lowercase letters.
- `widths` is an array of length `26`.
- `widths[i]` will be in the range of `[2, 10]`.


## 解决
通过遍历字符串`S`来判断，若字母对应的宽度能够满足剩下的位置，就直接放进该行中，若不行，则新开一行来放置这些字母。
【n为字符串`S`的长度】

- 时间复杂度：O(n)
- 空间复杂度：O(1)

```C++
// Runtime: 3ms
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numberOfLines(vector<int>& widths, string S) {
        vector<int> result;
        int lines = 1;
        int units = 0;
        int len = S.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (units + widths[S[i] - 'a'] <= 100) {
                // if it can fit in the rest of the positions
                units += widths[S[i] - 'a'];
            } else {
                // if it can't fit in the rest of the positions
                // creat a new lines to put it in
                lines++;
                units = widths[S[i] - 'a'];
            }
        }
        result.push_back(lines);
        result.push_back(units);
        return result;
    }
};
```
